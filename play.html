    <h4>AUGUST STRINDBERG</h4>
    <p>
     <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6>
     <p class="speech">Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
         lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>
     <h6 class="MISSY" >MISS Y.</h6>
     <p class="direction"> [ _looks up from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
         her reading_.]</p>

     <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6>
     <p class="speech">Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
          restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
          when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
          reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
          witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
          Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
          to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
          dear.</p>

     <p class="direction"> [_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_ MRS. X.,
           _and disappears again_.</p>

      <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6>
      <p class="direction">[_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
          of Christmas presents._]</p>
          <p class="speech"> See what I've bought for my tots. </p>
          <p class="direction">[_Picks up a doll._]</p>
          <p class="speech"> What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
          eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
          pistol for Carl.</p>

     <p class="direction">[_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ MISS Y. MISS Y. _starts as if
          frightened_.</p>

     <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6> 
     <p class="speech">Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
          did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
          were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
          in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
          it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
          didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
          matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.
          [_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._] Well, these are for my
          hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
          must have them on everything.</p>
     <h6 class="MISSY" >MISS Y.</h6>
     <p class="direction"> [ _looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
          sarcasm and curiosity_.</p>

     <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6> 
     <p class="direction"> [_Puts a hand in each slipper._] </p> 
     <p class="speech"> see what small feet Bob
          has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never
          seen him in slippers.</p>
     <h6 class="MISSY" >MISS Y.</h6>
     <p class="direction"> [ _laughs aloud_.</p>
     <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6> 
     <p class="speech"> Look here--here he comes.</p>

     <p class="direction"> [_Makes the slippers walk across the table._ MISS Y. _laughs
          again_.</p>
     <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6> 
     <p class="speech"> Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this:
         "Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." Or: "The
          idiot--now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then
          there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold. "Gee, but
          it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep
          the house warm."</p>
