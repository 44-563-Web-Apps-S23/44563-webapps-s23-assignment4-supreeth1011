    <p class="speech">Well, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
        lonely as a poor bachelor.</p>

        her reading_.]</p>

    <h6 class="MRSX">MRS. X.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
         restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
         when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
         reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
         witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
         Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
         to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
         dear.</p>
